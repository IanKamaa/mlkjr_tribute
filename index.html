                    <strong>1929-</strong>
                    <strong>Birth</strong><br>
                    King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta,
                     Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King and Alberta King (née Williams).King's mother named him Michael,
                     which was entered onto the birth certificate by the attending physician
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> 1944-</strong>
                    <strong>Morehouse College</strong><br>
                    at the age of 15, King passed the entrance examination and was enrolled at the university for the school season that autumn.
                 In the summer before King started his freshman year at Morehouse,
                 he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett "Weasel" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College
                 students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco (a cigar business). This 
                 was King's first trip outside of the segregated south into the integrated north
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Crozer Theological Seminary-</strong>
                    King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania. King's father
                     fully supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family 
                    friend who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania.[
                    
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1951-</strong>
                    <strong>Boston University</strong><br>
                    King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University.[84] While pursuing doctoral studies, King worked as an assistant
                    minister at Boston's historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester.

                    <strong>1953-</strong>
                    <strong>Marriage and family</strong><br>
                    King married Coretta Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of Heiberger,
                     Alabama. They became the parents of four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957),
                      Dexter Scott King (b. 1961), and Bernice King (b. 1963).[94] During their marriage, King limited Coretta's role in 
                      the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.

                    <strong>1955-</strong>
                    <strong>Montgomery bus boycott</strong><br>
                    In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat 
                    to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. 
                    King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; E. D. Nixon and Clifford
                     Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue because the incident involved a minor. Nine months later on December 1, 1955,
                      a similar incident occurred when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.The two incidents led
                       to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Nixon and led by King.

                    <strong>1957-</strong>
                    <strong>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</strong><br>
                    King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the
                     Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches
                      to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform

                    <strong>1959</strong>
                    <strong>The Measure of A Man</strong><br>
                    In 1959, King published a short book called The Measure of A Man, which contained his sermons 
                    "What is Man?" and "The Dimensions of a Complete Life." The sermons argued for man's need for God's love 
                    and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization

                    <strong>1963-</strong>
                    <strong>Birmingham campaign</strong><br>
                    In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama.
                     The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker.

                    <strong>1964-</strong>
                    <strong>St. Augustine, Florida</strong><br>
                    In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling's then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida.
                     Hayling's group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense
                     alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them

                    <strong>1966-</strong>
                    <strong>Chicago open housing movement</strong><br>
                    In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to 
                    the North, with Chicago as their first destination. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building
                     at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale on Chicago's West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate 
                     their support and empathy for the poor

                    <strong>Poor People's Campaign</strong><br>
                    In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice. 
                    King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in 
                    nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an "economic bill of rights" for poor Americans

                    <strong>1968-</strong>
                    <strong>Assassination</strong><br>
                    King was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01 p.m., Thursday, April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel's second-floor balcony. 
                    The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder
                    After emergency chest surgery, King died at St. Joseph's Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch,
                     King's autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he "had the heart of a 60 year old", which Branch attributed to the stress
                     of 13 years in the civil rights movement.King is buried within Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.

                    <strong>Aftermath</strong><br>
                    The assassination led to a nationwide wave of race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, 
                    and dozens of other cities. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign
                     rally when he was informed of King's death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the 
                     tragedy and urging them to continue King's ideal of nonviolence. The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland
